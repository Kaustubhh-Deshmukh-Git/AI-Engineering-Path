## 📅 Daily Engineering Log

### 📅 Log: Feb 3, 2026 (The "Sort & Map" Breakthrough)
**Status:** 🟢 Active (Heavy Output)

**Engineering Practice (DSA):**
* **🏆 Victory:** Solved **Group Anagrams (LeetCode 49)**.
    * *Concept:* Implemented `unordered_map<string, vector<string>>`.
    * *Technique:* Used sorted strings as hash keys (Canonical Form) to group anagrams efficiently.
* **⚔️ Contest (CodeClash):** Scored **1/2**.
    * *Solved:* String Pattern (Easy).
    * *Missed:* Max Sum Subarray of Size K (Medium).
    * *Lesson:* Identified a gap in **Sliding Window** logic. Brute force ($O(N^2)$) timed out; need $O(N)$ linear approach.
* **🏋️‍♀️ Drills (NxtWave):** Completed 11 C++ Basics Modules.
    * *Focus:* 2D Arrays, Diagonals, String Concatenation. High-volume syntax reinforcement.

**Note:** "The medium problem is just a hard problem broken into small easy steps."

#### **[2026-02-02] Day 12: The Dual-Core Start**
* **Status:** 🟢 Active (High Intensity)
* **Strategy:** Initiated "Parallel Threads" protocol.
    * **Thread 1 (Theory):** Started **CS:APP Chapter 2** (Representing Information). Deep dive into Hexadecimal, Two's Complement, and bitwise operations.
    * **Thread 2 (Practice):** Started **Chapter 2: Medium Arrays & Hashing** (DSA).
* **Engineering Challenge:**
    * **Group Anagrams (LeetCode 49):** Implemented a complex HashMap (`unordered_map<string, vector<string>>`) to group strings by their sorted signature ($O(N \cdot K \log K)$).

#### **[2026-01-26] to [2026-02-01] Days 5-11: The Academic Sprint**
* **Status:** 🟡 Maintenance Mode (Leadership & Operations)
* **Summary:** Paused technical development to manage critical deliverables for "Sanskriti" Club and college academics.
* **Key Achievements:**
    * **Leadership:** Managed Design/Ops for the "Ancient Dwarka" theme reveal.
    * **Academics:** Cleared assignment backlog to free up February bandwidth.
    * **Milestone:** Officially closed **CS:APP Chapter 1**.

#### **[2026-01-25] Day 4: Systems & Networking**
* **Status:** 🟡 Recovery / Networking
* **Focus:** CS:APP Chapter 1 (Completion).
* **Technical Takeaways:**
    * **Virtual Memory:** Studied how the OS abstracts physical RAM (Section 1.7).
    * **Amdahl's Law:** Analyzed the theoretical limits of system speedup (Section 1.9).
* **Non-Technical:** Attended college club event; focused on peer networking.

#### **[2026-01-24] Day 3: The Reset**
* **Status:** ⚠️ Partial / Recovery
* **Focus:** System Architecture (Memory Hierarchy).
* **Technical Details:**
    * Read CS:APP Section 1.5 (Caches).
    * Learned about the L1/L2/L3 cache hierarchy and why "spatial locality" matters for performance.
* **Note:** Lost the day to personal issues. Rebooting protocol for Sunday.

#### **[2026-01-23] Day 2: Unsupervised Learning & Systems Fundamentals**
* **Status:** ✅ Completed
* **Focus:** Advanced ML Techniques (Clustering/PCA) & Low-Level Architecture.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Machine Learning:**
        * **Clustering:** Implemented K-Means to segment unlabeled datasets.
        * **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to compress high-dimensional data, optimizing for variance vs. speed.
    * **Systems Engineering (CS:APP):**
        * Started **Chapter 1 & 2 (Bits & Integers)**.
        * Investigating the compilation pipeline (Source -> Assembly -> Binary) and how `int` data types are represented in memory (Two's Complement).
* **Artifact:** MATLAB "Machine Learning Techniques" Certificate Earned.

#### **[2026-01-22] Day 1: Supervised Learning & Model Evaluation**
* **Status:** ✅ Completed
* **Focus:** Classification & Regression Mathematics.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Theory:** Mastered Confusion Matrices, ROC/AUC Curves, and RMSE minimization.
    * **Implementation:** Built predictive models using MATLAB's Classification Learner.
    * **Insight:** False Negatives are costlier than False Positives in critical systems (e.g., medical/autonomous driving); optimized recall accordingly.
