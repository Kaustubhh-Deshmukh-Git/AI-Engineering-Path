## 📅 Daily Engineering Log

#### **[2026-01-22] Day 1: Supervised Learning & Model Evaluation**
* **Status:** ✅ Completed
* **Focus:** Classification & Regression Mathematics.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Theory:** Mastered Confusion Matrices, ROC/AUC Curves, and RMSE minimization.
    * **Implementation:** Built predictive models using MATLAB's Classification Learner.
    * **Insight:** False Negatives are costlier than False Positives in critical systems (e.g., medical/autonomous driving); optimized recall accordingly.
