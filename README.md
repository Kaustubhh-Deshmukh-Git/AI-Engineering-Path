## 📅 Daily Engineering Log

#### **[2026-01-24] Day 3: The Reset**
* **Status:** ⚠️ Partial / Recovery
* **Focus:** System Architecture (Memory Hierarchy).
* **Technical Details:**
    * Read CS:APP Section 1.5 (Caches).
    * Learned about the L1/L2/L3 cache hierarchy and why "spatial locality" matters for performance.
* **Note:** Lost the day to personal issues. rebooting protocol for Sunday.

#### **[2026-01-23] Day 2: Unsupervised Learning & Systems Fundamentals**
* **Status:** ✅ Completed
* **Focus:** Advanced ML Techniques (Clustering/PCA) & Low-Level Architecture.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Machine Learning:**
        * **Clustering:** Implemented K-Means to segment unlabeled datasets.
        * **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to compress high-dimensional data, optimizing for variance vs. speed.
    * **Systems Engineering (CS:APP):**
        * Started **Chapter 1 & 2 (Bits & Integers)**.
        * Investigating the compilation pipeline (Source -> Assembly -> Binary) and how `int` data types are represented in memory (Two's Complement).
* **Artifact:** MATLAB "Machine Learning Techniques" Certificate Earned.

#### **[2026-01-22] Day 1: Supervised Learning & Model Evaluation**
* **Status:** ✅ Completed
* **Focus:** Classification & Regression Mathematics.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Theory:** Mastered Confusion Matrices, ROC/AUC Curves, and RMSE minimization.
    * **Implementation:** Built predictive models using MATLAB's Classification Learner.
    * **Insight:** False Negatives are costlier than False Positives in critical systems (e.g., medical/autonomous driving); optimized recall accordingly.
